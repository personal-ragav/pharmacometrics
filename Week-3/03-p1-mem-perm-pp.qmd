# Question 1

London Marriott, an intern in Pharmaceutical R&D at Drugs-R-Us, a major pharmaceutical company, was directed to carry out a series of studies on the intestinal absorption of the new lead compound (DRUXX2) in the Drugs-R-Us anti-aging program. London carried out the studies as directed, but did not finish the project because she was called to Washington D.C. to help Hillary Clinton settle a trade dispute with the French government over perfume imports. Therefore, it falls to you, the Pharm.D. in charge of clinical development, to interpret her notebooks.

In carrying out absorption rate studies, the following data were collected. These data should be plotted in AlgebraOfGraphics.

```{julia}
conc = [5, 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200]
rate = [1.25, 2.2, 4.6, 5.9, 7.4, 8.1, 8.5]

df = DataFrame(conc = conc, concu = "g/mL", abs_rate=rate, abs_rateu = "mg/min")
simple_table(df)
```

# Question 2

The data below describe the absorption of a drug from the gastrointestinal tract. What can you conclude about the mechanism of the absorption and the order of the transport process and why?

```{julia}
conc = [1, 2, 5, 15, 30]
abs_rate = [20, 40, 100, 300, 600]

df = DataFrame(conc = conc, concu = "μg/mL", abs_rate=abs_rate, abs_rateu = "μg/min")
simple_table(df)
```

```{julia}
lst = Vector{Markdown.MD}()
M(str::String) = Markdown.parse(str)

n = nrow(df)
concu = only(unique(df[!, :concu]))
abs_rateu = only(unique(df[!, :abs_rateu]))

for i in 1:n
	if i < n
		conc1 = df[i, :conc]
		conc2 = df[i+1, :conc]
		conc_rat = conc2/conc1
		abs_rate1 = df[i, :abs_rate]
		abs_rate2 = df[i+1, :abs_rate]
		abs_rate_rat = abs_rate2 / abs_rate1


		push!(lst, Markdown.parse("From **$conc1** to **$conc2** $concu (**$(conc_rat)x**), absorption rate changes from **$abs_rate1** to **$abs_rate2** $abs_rateu (**$(abs_rate_rat)x**)"))
	end
end

display.(lst);

plt = data(df) * mapping(:conc, :abs_rate) * visual(ScatterLines)

display(draw(plt; figure=(;title = "conc vs abs rate"), axis = (; width = 400, height = 360))) # 

display(M("This suggests that **rate of absorption is directly proportional to concentration**. That is:"))
display(@latexify Rate = 𝑘 * Conc env=:equation)

display(M("This is the hallmark of a **first-order process**, where the rate depends linearly on the concentration."))

display(M("### Conclusion:"))
display(M("**Mechanism**: Likely **passive diffusion** (which often follows first-order kinetics unless saturated)."))
display(M("**Order of transport process**: **First-order kinetics**, because the rate of absorption increases proportionally with concentration."))
```

# Question 3

A new antibiotic tablet was developed and administered to a group of volunteers.

- 40% of the orally administered dose was excreted unchanged in the feces.
- In another study, it was shown that the drug was not excreted in the bile, and that the extraction ratio of the drug by the liver was 70%.
- Calculate the bioavailability of this drug in this dosage form. (Assume that no gut wall metabolism exists).

**Bioavailability Calculation**

Given:
- 40% of the orally administered dose is excreted unchanged in feces  
  $$
  F_{\text{abs}} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
  $$

- Hepatic extraction ratio:  
  $$
  E_H = 0.70
  $$
- No gut wall metabolism

**Bioavailability Formula**:
$$
F = F_{\text{abs}} \times (1 - E_H)
$$

**Substitute the values**:
$$
F = 0.60 \times (1 - 0.70) = 0.60 \times 0.30 = 0.18
$$

**Final Answer**:
$$
\boxed{F = 0.18 \quad \text{or} \quad 18\%}
$$


# Question 4

1. Two membrane characteristics that will increase the rate of absorption of a drug across the membrane are an increase in <ins>**surface area**</ins> or a decrease in <ins>**membrane thickness**</ins>.

2. Two drug characteristics that will decrease its rate of absorption across the membrane are a decrease in <ins>**molecular size**</ins> or an increase in <ins>**drug lipophilicity**</ins>.

3. Proteins and phospholipids each have both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics. This is why they are known as <ins>**amphipathic**</ins> molecules.

4. If a molecule has a relatively low octanol to water partition coefficient, you would expect its passive diffusion across a membrane to be <ins>**slow**</ins>.

5. The anatomical feature of the small intestine that most enhances its surface area is the <ins>**villi**</ins>.

6. The barrier to absorption in the small intestine is the <ins>**mucus layer**</ins>.

7. The cell type with the "leakiest" tight junction is the <ins>**brain capillary**</ins>.

8. When a molecule crosses through the cell, it is considered to go through the <ins>**transcellular**</ins> route across the barrier.

9. When a molecule goes between cells, it is considered to go through the <ins>**paracellular**</ins> route across the barrier.
