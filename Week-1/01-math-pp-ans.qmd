`{julia} L"k = 0.693 / t_{1/2}"`

\

11-15. A patient is given a single **intravenous bolus** dose of **500 mg** of Drug X. The drug’s volume of distribution is **Vd = 50 L** and its clearance is **CL = 5 L/hour**. Assume a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.

#
11. Using the scenario above, calculate the **initial plasma drug concentration** $C_0$
 immediately after the IV bolus dose (at t = 0). *Hint: assume instant distribution of the dose in the volume of distribution.*

```{julia}
Dose = 500
Vd = 50
CL = 5

Cₒ = Dose/Vd

println("The initial concentration is $Cₒ mg/L.")
```

#
12. Calculate the **elimination rate constant** k for Drug X using the provided clearance and volume of distribution (CL and Vd).

$k = \frac{CL}{V_d}$

```{julia}
k = CL / Vd

println("The elimination rate constant for Drug X is $k h⁻¹")
```

#
13. Using your result from question 12, calculate the elimination half-life $t_\frac{1}{2}$ of Drug X.

$t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$

```{julia}
tₕ = 0.693/k

println("The elimination half-life for Drug X is $(round(tₕ, digits=3)) hours")
```

#
14. Write the formula for the **plasma concentration as a function of time** $C(t)$, for Drug X in this one-compartment model. (Use the values $C_0$ and $k$ from the scenario in your expression.)

$$
C(t) = C_0 . e^{-kt}
$$

#
15. Using the formula from question 14, calculate the plasma drug concentration at t = 4 hours for Drug X.

```{julia}
t = 4

println("Cₒ = $Cₒ mg/L")
println("k = $k h⁻¹")
println("t = $t h")

Cₜ = Cₒ * ℯ^(-k*t)

println("\nThe plasma drug concentration Cₜ at t = 4 is $Cₜ mg/L")
```

#
16. In another patient, the plasma drug concentration was **80 mg/L at 1 hour** after dosing and **20 mg/L at 5 hours** after dosing. Assuming first-order elimination, calculate the **elimination rate constant** $k$ for this drug in the patient. *(Hint: use the two concentration–time points to solve for $k$.)*

```{julia}
c₁ = 80 
t₁ = 1 

c₂ = 20
t₂ = 5;
```


Rate law equation at t₁
$$
\begin{align}
\ln(c_1) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot t_1 \\
\ln(80) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 1 \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

Rate law equation at t₂
$$
\begin{align}
\ln(c_2) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot t_2 \\
\ln(20) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 5 \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

Solving for equation (1) and (2)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln(80) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 1 \\
\ln(20) &= \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 5 \\
\hline
\ln(80) - \ln(20) &= \left( \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 1 \right) - \left( \ln(c_0) - k \cdot 5 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Final equation
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln(80) - \ln(20) &= 4 \cdot k
\end{aligned}
$$

```{julia}
k = (log(80) - log(20)) / (4)
println("The elimination rate constant is $(round(k, digits=3)) h⁻¹")
```

#
17. Using the $k$ from question 16, calculate the **elimination half-life** of the drug for that patient.

```{julia}
tₕ = 0.693/k

println("The elimination half life is $(round(tₕ, digits=3)) hours")
```

#
18. Write the **differential equation** describing the rate of change of drug amount $A(t)$ in the body for a continuous **IV infusion** at rate $R_0$ (zero-order input) with first-order elimination (rate constant $k$). *(Assume a one-compartment model and no other losses.)*

To derive the differential equation for the amount of drug $A(t)$ in the body, we'll consider the following:

- **Zero-order infusion**: The drug is infused at a constant rate $R_0$, meaning the rate of drug input to the body is constant.
- **First-order elimination**: The drug is eliminated from the body at a rate proportional to the amount of drug in the body, with a rate constant $k$.

**Key Assumptions**:

- **One-compartment model**: The drug distributes uniformly in the body and no losses.
- **Continuous IV infusion**: The drug is being infused at a constant rate $R_0$.
- **First-order elimination**: The rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the amount of drug in the body.

**Steps to derive the differential equation:**

1. **Drug Input**:
The rate of drug infusion is constant at $R_0$, so the rate of drug input into the body is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dA}{dt} = R_0
\end{aligned}
$$

2. **Drug Output**: The rate of drug elimination is proportional to the amount of drug present in the body, so the rate of elimination is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dA}{dt} = k \cdot A(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $A(t)$ the amount of drug in the body at time $𝑡$ and $𝑘$ is the first-order rate constant for elimination.

**Final Differential Equation** (Input - output)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dA}{dt} = R_0 - k \cdot A(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:

- $A(t)$ is the amount of drug in the body at time $𝑡$.
- $R_0$ ​is the constant infusion rate (zero-order input).
- $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.

This equation describes the rate of change of the drug amount in the body over time.

#
19. For the IV bolus **scenario in questions 11–15** (500 mg dose, CL = 5 L/h), calculate the **AUC from 0 to ∞**. Include units in your answer.

```{julia}
Doseᵢᵥ = 500
CL = 5

AUC₀₋ᵢₙ = Doseᵢᵥ / CL

println("The Area under the curve (0 - ∞) is $AUC₀₋ᵢₙ mg.h/L")
```

#
20. For a zero-order elimination process with a rate constant $k_0 = 2\, \text{mg/L/hour}$ and an initial concentration $C_0 = 20\, \text{mg/L}$ , how long will it take for the concentration to drop to half of its initial value? Show your calculation.

**Half-life for Zero-order**
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_{1/2} = \frac{0.5 \cdot c_0}{k_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

```{julia}
kₒ = 2
cₒ = 20

tₕ = 0.5 * cₒ / kₒ
println("The time taken for the concentration to drop to half its initial value is $tₕ hours")
```

#
21. A drug’s clearance is reported as **5 L/hour** in a 70-kg patient. Convert this clearance to **mL/min/kg**. *(Perform the unit conversions step by step.)*

```{julia}
CL_old = 5 # L/hour

# Clearance in mL/min
CL_new = CL_old * (1000/60) # 1 L/hour = 1000/60 mL/min

# Clearance in mL/min/kg
CL_new_by_mass = CL_new / 70 

println("The value is $(round(CL_new_by_mass, digits = 3)) mL/min/kg")
```

#
22. A single IV dose of **100 mg** of Drug Y produces an **AUC₀₋∞** of **25 mg·h/L**. Calculate the **clearance (CL)** of Drug Y in L/hour.

```{julia}
Doseᵢᵥ = 100
AUC₀₋ᵢₙ = 25

CL = Doseᵢᵥ / AUC₀₋ᵢₙ

println("The clearance is $CL L/hour")
```

#
23. Derivation: Show that for a one-compartment model, $CL = k \cdot V_d$

Given:

- A one-compartment model is used.
- $CL$ = Clearance, 
- $k$ = Elimination rate constant, and 
- $V_d$ = Volume of distribution.
- $AUC_{0-∞}$ = Area Under the Concentration-Time curve.
- $C_0$ = Initial concentration.
- $Dose$

**Step 1: Expression for $AUC_{0-∞}$** 

For a one-compartment model, the concentration-time curve follows an exponential decay, and the AUC is the integral of this curve over time.
$$
\begin{align}
AUC_{0-∞} = \frac{C_0}{k} \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

**Step 2: Relationship between $C_0$ and $Dose$**

After the dose is administered, the initial concentration in the body is the dose divided by the volume in which the drug is distributed.
$$
\begin{align}
C_0 = \frac{Dose}{V_d} \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

**Step 3: Expression for $CL$ from $AUC_{0-∞}$**

Now, the clearance $CL$ is defined as the ratio of the $Dose$ to the area under the concentration-time curve $AUC_{0-∞}$

$$
\begin{align}
CL = \frac{Dose}{AUC_{0-∞}} \tag{3}
\end{align}
$$

**Step 4: Substitute the expressions for $AUC_{0-∞}$ and $C_0$**

Substituting $(1)$ and $(3)$
$$
\begin{align}
CL = \frac{Dose}{\frac{C_0}{k}}
\end{align}
$$

Simplifying
$$
\begin{align}
CL = \frac{Dose \cdot k}{C_0}
\end{align}
$$

Substituting $(2)$
$$
\begin{align}
CL = \frac{Dose \cdot k}{\frac{Dose}{V_d}}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, we have derived the desired result:

$$
\begin{align}
CL = k \cdot V_d
\end{align}
$$

#
24. A drug’s plasma concentration must drop to **25% of its initial value** before the next dose. If the elimination rate constant is $k = 0.10h^{-1}$, how long will this take? *Show your calculation (solve for time)*. 

Assuming IV bolus and 1st order elimination process, the concentration across time $t$ is given by
$$
\begin{align}
C(t) = C_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot t} \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

Concentration reduces to 0.25 of initial value, rewriting the equation $(1)$
$$
\begin{align}
0.25 \cdot {C_0} &= C_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot t} \\
0.25 &= e^{-k \cdot t}
\end{align}
$$

Taking Natural log on both sides
$$
\begin{align}
\ln{(0.25)} &= \ln{(e^{-k \cdot t})} \\
\ln{(0.25)} &= -k \cdot t
\end{align}
$$

Finally
$$
t = -\frac{\ln{(0.25)}}{k}
$$

```{julia}
k = 0.10 # h⁻¹
t = -log(0.25)/0.1

print("The time taken to reach 25% of C₀ is $(round(t, digits=3))")
```

#
25. Explain why the half-life of a **first-order** elimination process is constant (independent of concentration), whereas the time to halve the concentration in a **zero-order** process depends on the initial concentration. *Use the mathematical expressions for first-order and zero-order concentration decay to support your explanation.*

| First Order reaction              | Zero Order reaction                 |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|$C(t) = C_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot t}$  |$C(t) =  C_0 - k_0 \cdot t$          |
|$C(t_{1/2}) = 0.5 \cdot C_0$       |$C(t_{1/2}) = 0.5 \cdot C_0$         |
|$0.5 = e^-{k \cdot t}$             |$0.5 \cdot C_0 = C_0 - k_0 \cdot t$  |
|$\ln(2) = k \cdot t$               |$0.5 \cdot C_0 = k_0 \cdot t$        |
|$t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k}$       |$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.5 \cdot C_0}{k_0}$|

#
26. Derivation: Solve the differential equation `{julia} latexify("dC/dt = -k*C")` with initial condition `{julia} latexify("C(0) = C_0")` Show the steps to derive the solution `{julia} L"C(t) = C_0 . e^{-kt}"` (Hint: separate variables and integrate.)

According to rate law,
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dC}{dt} = -k \cdot C
\end{align}
$$

Rearranging
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dC}{C} = -k \cdot dt
\end{align}
$$

Integrating both sides

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{C_0}^{C}\frac{dC}{C} = - \int_{0}^{t} k \cdot dt
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\ln{(C)} - \ln{(C_0)} = -k \cdot t \\
\ln{(C)} = \ln{(C_0)} - k \cdot t
\end{align}
$$

exponentiating both sides
$$
\begin{align}
e^{\ln{(C)}} &= e^{\ln{(C_0)} - k \cdot t} \\
C &= C_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot t}
\end{align}
$$

#
27. Derivation: Solve the differential equation $dA/dt = R_0 - k \cdot A$ for an infusion with first-order elimination (from question 18). Assume $A(0) = 0$. Provide the expression for $A(t)$. (Hint: this ODE reaches a steady-state as $t \,\to\, ∞$.)

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dA}{dt} + k \cdot A = R_0
\end{align}
$$

Multiplying using integrating factor $e^{k \cdot t}$ 

[if $\frac{dx}{dy} + P(y) \cdot x = Q(t)$, I.F. = $e^{P(t) \cdot dt}$]

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dA}{dt} \cdot e^{k \cdot t} + k \cdot A \cdot e^{kt} = R_0 \cdot e^{k \cdot t}
\end{equation}
$$

Using product rule on LHS
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}(A \cdot e^{kt}) = R_0 \cdot e^{k \cdot t}
\end{align}
$$

Integrating both sides based on $t$ 
[$\frac{d}{dx}(F(x)) \cdot dx = F(x) + C$]

$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{d}{dt}(A \cdot e^{kt}) \cdot dt &= \int R_0 \cdot e^{k \cdot t} \cdot dt \\
A(t) \cdot e^{kt} &= \frac{R_0}{k} \cdot e^{k \cdot t} + C
\end{align}
$$

Dividing by $e^{kt}$

$$
\begin{align}
A(t) = \frac{R_0}{k} + C \cdot e^{-k \cdot t} \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

Applying $A(0) = 0$ and $t = 0$, $C = -\frac{R_0}{k} \tag{2}$

Substituting $(2)$ in $(1)$, The expression for $A(t)$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
A(t) &= \frac{R_0}{k} - \frac{R_0}{k} \cdot e^{-k \cdot t} \\
A(t) &= \frac{R_0}{k}(1 -  e^{-k \cdot t})
\end{align}
$$

As $t \,\to\, ∞$, the exponential term $e^{-k \cdot t} \,\to\, 0$, and the steady-state value of $A(t)$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
A_{steady} = \frac{R_0}{k}
\end{align}
$$

30. For a first-order elimination process, approximately **how many half-life periods** are needed for more than **95%** of the drug to be eliminated from the body? Justify your answer with calculations or reasoning
