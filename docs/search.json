Explain.\nAnswer:\nStep 1: Determine Hepatic Clearance (CL_H)\nWe are given:\n\nTotal body clearance (CL) = 0.2 L/min\nRenal excretion = 2% of dose → Renal clearance (CL_R) ≈ 0.02 × 0.2 L/min = 0.004 L/min\nHepatic clearance (CL_H) = CL - CL_R = 0.2 - 0.004 = 0.196 L/min\n\nStep 2: Hepatic Extraction Ratio (E_H)\nLiver blood flow (Q) = 1350 mL/min = 1.35 L/min\nHepatic extraction ratio (E_H) = CL_H / Q = 0.196 / 1.35 ≈ 0.145\nStep 3: Interpretation of Extraction Ratio\nAn extraction ratio E_H &lt; 0.3 indicates a low-extraction drug.\nFor such drugs, hepatic clearance is governed by:\n\\[\nCL_H = \\frac{f_u \\cdot V_{MAX}}{K_m + f_u \\cdot C}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(f_u\\): free fraction (0.25)\n\\(V_{MAX}\\): maximum metabolic rate\n\\(K_m\\): Michaelis constant\n\\(C\\): drug concentration\n\nStep 4: Effect of Enzyme Induction\nSince the drug has low hepatic extraction, its clearance is capacity-limited (enzyme-limited) and sensitive to changes in V_MAX.\nDoubling V_MAX would increase CL_H, as the liver’s capacity to metabolize the drug increases. Therefore, hepatic clearance would be markedly affected by an enzyme-inducing agent.\nConclusion\nYes, the hepatic clearance of this low-extraction, capacity-limited drug would be markedly affected by an enzyme-inducing agent that doubles V_MAX."

    "text": "2.2 (b) Diffusion Rate-Limited Distribution\nWhat is meant by diffusion rate-limited distribution?\n\nDiffusion rate-limited distribution refers to a pharmacokinetic situation where the rate at which a drug enters tissue from the bloodstream is limited by the drug’s ability to cross biological membranes, rather than by blood flow.\nThis typically occurs with drugs that are large, polar, hydrophilic, or ionized, which do not easily diffuse across lipid-rich cell membranes.\nAs a result, even if blood perfusion is adequate, the drug’s entry into tissues such as the brain, muscle, or fat may be slow.\nTissues protected by barriers like the blood-brain barrier often show diffusion-limited behavior due to tight junctions and low membrane permeability.\nIn such cases, drug concentrations in tissue rise gradually, potentially delaying therapeutic effects.\nThis is in contrast to perfusion rate-limited distribution, where membrane permeability is high and the rate-limiting step is blood flow."

Explain your reasoning.\nAnswer:\n\nPlasma protein binding = 60–80% → average = 70%\nApparent Volume of Distribution (Vd) = 1.1–2.2 L/kg → average = 1.65 L/kg\nFor a 70 kg individual:\nVd ≈ 1.65 L/kg × 70 kg = 115.5 L\n\nAnalysis:\n\nA large Vd suggests that the drug extensively distributes out of the plasma and into tissues.\nIf Drug Y were highly bound only to plasma proteins, it would mostly remain in the vascular compartment, resulting in a low Vd (~5 L).\nSince Vd is &gt;100 L, this implies significant tissue distribution, meaning Drug Y likely binds more extensively to tissue proteins.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDrug Y is more tightly bound to tissue proteins than to serum proteins.\nThis is indicated by its large volume of distribution (~115.5 L in a 70 kg individual), which suggests extensive distribution into tissues, beyond what would be expected if it were mainly bound to plasma proteins."

(Assume that no gut wall metabolism exists).\n\nBioavailability Calculation\nGiven: - 40% of the orally administered dose is excreted unchanged in feces\n\\[\n  F_{\\text{abs}} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n  \\]\n\nHepatic extraction ratio:\n\\[\nE_H = 0.70\n\\]\nNo gut wall metabolism\n\nBioavailability Formula: \\[\nF = F_{\\text{abs}} \\times (1 - E_H)\n\\]\nSubstitute the values: \\[\nF = 0.60 \\times (1 - 0.70) = 0.60 \\times 0.30 = 0.18\n\\]\nFinal Answer: \\[\n\\boxed{F = 0.18 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 18\\%}\n\\]\n\n\n4 Question 4\n\nTwo membrane characteristics that will increase the rate of absorption of a drug across the membrane are an increase in surface area or a decrease in membrane thickness.\nTwo drug characteristics that will decrease its rate of absorption across the membrane are a decrease in molecular size or an increase in drug lipophilicity.\nProteins and phospholipids each have both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics. This is why they are known as amphipathic molecules.\nIf a molecule has a relatively low octanol to water partition coefficient, you would expect its passive diffusion across a membrane to be slow.\nThe anatomical feature of the small intestine that most enhances its surface area is the villi.\nThe barrier to absorption in the small intestine is the mucus layer.\nThe cell type with the “leakiest” tight junction is the brain capillary.\nWhen a molecule crosses through the cell, it is considered to go through the transcellular route across the barrier.\nWhen a molecule goes between cells, it is considered to go through the paracellular route across the barrier.\n\n\n\n5 Question 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nDescription\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n1\nCan cause an increase in membrane viscosity\ni.

Why?\n\nAnswer\nThe maximum value that an extraction ratio can have is 1.\n\\(\\small{E = \\dfrac{C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}}{C_{\\text{in}}}}\\)\nIf 100% of the drug is extracted by the organ, then \\(\\small{C_{\\text{out}} = 0}\\) , so \\(\\small{E = \\dfrac{C_{\\text{in}} - 0}{C_{\\text{in}}} = 1}\\), meaning the organ extracts all of the drug that passes through it.\n\n\nWhat is the minimum value for an extraction ratio?\n\nAnswer\nThe minimum value for an extraction ratio is 0\nIf no drug is removed, then \\(\\small{C_{\\text{in}} = C_{\\text{out}}}\\), so \\(\\small{E = \\frac{C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{in}}}{C_{\\text{in}}} = 0}\\), meaning the organ does not extract any of the drug from the blood.\n\n\nIf the flow into an organ is 1 liter per minute, what is the maximum organ clearance? Why?\n\nAnswer\nThe maximum organ clearance (\\(\\small{E}\\)) is 1 L/min because \\(\\small{CL = E \\times Q}\\), and the maximum extraction ratio (\\(\\small{E}\\)) is 1\nThis implies that the maximum organ clearance is equal to the organ’s blood flow, as that is maximum rate at which drug can be presented to the organ for elimination.\n\n\nConsider an organ clearance of 2 liters per minute and the flow to that same organ is 2.2 liters per minute, would these data predict a high or low extraction ratio?\n\nAnswer\n\\(\\small{E = \\dfrac{CL}{Q}}\\)\n\n# Given\ncl = 2 # L/min\nq = 2.2 # L/min\n\n# Extraction ratio\ne = cl / q\n\nprintln(\"Extraction ratio (E): $(round(e, digits = 2)) \")\n\nExtraction ratio (E): 0.91 \n\n\nSince, \\(\\small{E &gt; 0.7}\\), it is a high extraction ratio\n\n\nDefine the extraction ratio.\n\nAnswer\nExtraction ratio is the fraction of drug entering that is eliminated on single passage through an organ. It is the ratio of rate of elimination to rate of presentation of drug to an eliminating organ.\n\n\nDrug distributes to a particular non-eliminating organ (organ X) (blood flow to organ X is 0.25 liter per minute). Calculate the organ clearance for organ X.\n\nAnswer\nThe organ clearance for organ X is \\(\\small{0\\ L/min}\\) because \\(\\small{CL = E \\times Q}\\), where \\(\\small{E = 0}\\) (non-eliminating organ) and \\(\\small{Q = 0.25\\ L/min}\\)\n\n\nDrug distributes to a particular eliminating organ (organ Y) (blood flow to organ Y is 1.2 liter per minute). Calculate the organ clearance for organ Y. (discuss the assumptions you made in your calculation)\n\nAnswer\n\\(\\small{CL_{\\text{organ}} = E \\times Q}\\), assuming moderate extraction ratio (\\(\\small{E = 0.5}\\)) because it is an eliminating organ\n\n# Given\ne = 0.5 \nq = 1.2 # L/min\n\n# Organ clearance\ncl = e * q\n\nprintln(\"Organ clearance: $cl L/min\")\n\nOrgan clearance: 0.6 L/min"
